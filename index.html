<p>Hello, my name is Liu Yekai.</p>
<br>
<p>I have been making my best endeavors to be a prominent software and electrical engineer. And I am a prospective full-stack web developer (which is a
powerful and fun area that I'm most interested in at this point of my career). I am a Chinese/English speaker, born in a beautiful small city near the Yangtze river: Anqing. Currently, I am working in the Vibrnat Wellness team at Vibrant America as Junior Software Engineer in the USA. I can be a fast learner and I am good at logical thinking and problem-solving. I am proficient in Python, C++, data structures & algorithms and I have a good knowledge of applied deep learning, Python for data analysis, and control theory. I hold a MS degree in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University and a BE degree in Automation and Control Engineering from Southeast University(Nanjing, China) from which Zhou Yuan ( the founder and CEO of China's largest Q&A Platform Zhihu) graduated as well.</p>
<br>
<p> I once worked for HoloPert HoloGraphics(GTSP) as a SDE intern. During the internship, I am involved in the development of a Windows desktop application called HoloPert_facecam virtual camera. It aims at the video from the user's webcam, combines it with the virtual backgrounds. The most popular usage of this application is to output processed webcam video in which backgrounds could be replaced with any virtual images as the video source to virtual camera interface in Zoom or other video meeting applications.The work of the whole project can be divided into 4 steps. And I am involved in the whole development process of all steps.</p>

<p>The first step is to train an image segmentation model for real-time and high-quality human portrait matting which can extract the human portrait (as the foreground part) from the background part of an image, which is implemented by semantic segmentation based on Python.</p>

<p>The second step is to make use of the model obtained from the first step to replace the background of users' webcam video with any virtual images or video, which is based on Python and torch (Python+Pytorch+OpenCV).</p>

<p>The third step is to output the processed video with the replaced virtual background as the video source to virtual camera interface/port in Zoom or other video call applications, for which we make use of an open-source Python module called "pyvirtualcam" (but we have modified the .cpp files in its library to re-build the .pyd dynamic link library file in order for some customized functions of our application).</p>

<p>The last step is to convert the python and pyd files of this project into one executable file with necessary but concise dependencies and then Inno setup software is used to create an installer of our application for Windows users.</p>
<br>
<p>In terms of web development, I have been learning HTML, DOM, Javascript, jQuery, Ajax, CSS, SQL/ MySQL, PHP and I am increasingly familiar with those web development programming tools and have a more and more comprehensive understanding and knowledge of the whole process for full-stack web development (including how to choose the frontend and server-side framework and how to register and maintain my own domain name for building my first personal website which is cool and easy). And I have managed to embed a Google map with a red marker pointing at Anqing into my webpage <a href="https://www.liuyekai.com/">(liuyekai.com)</a>.</p>
